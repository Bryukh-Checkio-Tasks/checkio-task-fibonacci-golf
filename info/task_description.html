    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_numbers">The Fibonacci numbers</a> or
    Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence:<br>
    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...<br>
    But it's not only one interesting integer sequence.
    There are many various sequences like the Fibonacci numbers,
    where each elements calculated with previous elements.
    Let's look and use several of them.
</p>

<p>
    Here are described several integer sequence which you should implement:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://oeis.org/A000045">fibonacci</a>:
        <pre>f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://oeis.org/A000073">tribonacci</a>:
        <pre>f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)+f(n-3)</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://oeis.org/A000032">lucas</a>:
        <pre>f(0)=2, f(1)=1, f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://oeis.org/A001045">jacobsthal</a>:
        <pre>f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(n)=f(n-1)+2*f(n-2)</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://oeis.org/A000129">pell</a>:
        <pre>f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(n)=2*f(n-1)+f(n-2)</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://oeis.org/A001608">perrin</a>:
        <pre>f(0)=3, f(1)=0, f(2)=2, f(n)=f(n-2)+f(n-3)</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://oeis.org/A000931">padovan</a>:
        <pre>f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(n)=f(n-2)+f(n-3)</pre>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You are given a name of sequence and a number "n".
    You should find the <strong>n-th</strong> element for the given sequence.
</p>

<p>
    In this mission the main goal to make your code as short as possible.
    But not a code as is it. We will check a length of the compiled code.
    The shorter your compiled code, the more points you earn.
    You can use <a href="https://github.com/cielavenir/checkio-task-fibonacci-golf/blob/master/local_checker.py">the
    local checker</a>
    to know the compiled size locally.
    Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code.
    For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used.
    1000 bytes is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points.
    For each byte less than 1000, you earn 1 point. For example for 300 byte long code earns you 700 points.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> Two arguments. A name of a sequence as a string and a number "n" as a positive integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> The n-th element of the sequence as an integer.<br>

</p>


<p>
    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    In this mission, you can learn how to code in DRY (don't repeat yourself) way.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Preconditions:</strong>
    10 &le; n &lt; 400
